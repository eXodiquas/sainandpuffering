# Sain and Puffering
Switcharoo around letters just for fun!

## Why?
This thing was created for [togglebits](https://www.twitch.tv/togglebit) terminal code jam. The theme was *pain and suffering*, and all people suffer whenever I switch the letters of words arounds in my daily use of language, so you can now suffer aswell by using this handy little tool. The sad part is, english is not a very regular language so I just have a dictionary in the assets folder with around 1500 nouns. If you want to add one for yourself just add a new line with the noun, if the plural is irregular you have to add it aswell.

## Compile and Run
- Get `dub` for your system, not sure if you have to get `dmd` as a D compiler aswell, or if `dub` depends on it.
- 'cd' into the source directory of this repository
- 'dub run -- "Your text to switcharoo, for sain and puffering.'
